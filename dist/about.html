                <p>My name is Joe and I am a JavaScript Developer. I am a graduate
                    of the Eleven Fifty Academy in Fishers, Indiana. I fell in love with 
                    technology as a kid and never looked back. My free time is usually
                    split between coding, photography, books, and video games.

                <p>
                    After graduating from Eleven Fifty in May of 2019 I have been working
                    with a few local businesses on website redesign and updates.

                <h6>Warehouse Manager 2013-2018</h6>
                <p>
                    I ran the main warehouse for an electrical contractor. I scheduled the days
                    deliveries and took care of all inventory needs. I also took care of all
                    shipping and receiving.

                <h6>Warehouse Manager 2001-2009</h6>
                <p>
                    My main focus at this job was on shipping/receiving and inventory. I would
                    coordinate with various jobsites and supply houses for the days deliveries.
                    I was in charge of making sure that the warehouse budget was always met.
